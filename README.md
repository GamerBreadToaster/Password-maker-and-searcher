# Password-maker-and-searcher
python program that makes an password, saves it in an local txt, and is able to search for an password.
I have made it as easy as possible and user friendly to save, and search for the password.

# Warning!
The passwords are not encrypted in any way and is possible to be seen in the normal notepad.
The file named passwords.txt can be copied by an hacker and is very vulnerable.
Use at your own risk, or for fun.

This was an passion project of mine and is probably very bad coding, chatgpt has helpt me begin the program and I have worked further on piece of code it gave me.
